**this file will contian the building steps techical thinking of the app

FOOD ORDERING APP
    : we have an app that shows you the list of available meals : which we will have to fetch from the backend 
    : then we need to have an cart option in where we store the meals that the user added to cart 
    : then we need to show this cart to them with calculation, in there we need to give them the option to increase the number times they can buy an item
    : then we need to show them the chek out where they will be able input there personal details
    : then we take all these deatils and send them over to the backend 


STEP ONE 
show the users the meals with an option to add them to the cart via a button
    - we use a useEffect to have full control over the rendering of the data, we recieve the data from the the object we recieve from the backend we map it
    - for every map we render a meal card and we pass on the index and all the requried data to that
    - once the menals are showing we get them to be showen in an particaular order

STEP TWO 
initalize a object which cotains the data we need to send to the backend matching the properites
    - on click on a specific button acrding to the click create a new property in the object with the data that has been clicked 
    - our origianl array does get updated but the catch is when we the array is updated with the new data, the old data remains there
    - the images are showen on the click of a button a new object is created in the array where we store which item the user added to cart
        - TO FIXES:
        - the inital values should not exist
        -  whever the same item is clicked more than once, we increase the quantity by one rather than creating a new object 

STEP THREE 
we show the data from the that we have collected to the user, in a box that 
over lays the actuall thign(for this we most probably have to watch the user inptu section as well )
        MODAL COMONENT:
        that is what we need here -
            - the backdrop , the component structure , component info

    - intial data collection and updation has been achieved 
    - show the data in an over lay such and then in there also put 
    - so we are now showing the data ass well as at the same time
    - on the click of a button array is being modified 

STEP 4
on the click of the button the screen in front disappears instead a input field is shown, where on the we can input the data for the conunation -
    - we take the info from the input field and we modify the old object using this data 
    - button to checkout
        - on click of this button the object we have here in our case "orderData" will be sent to the backend -- and we will recieve it
    - button to make the dialog disappear

STEP 5
make this app look pretty : not a proiority rn
make this app more interactable: not a priority rn
...Goal is to just get it to work: it is working --

GOAL ACIENVED


--THIS SHIT WON'T RUN VIA A URL HAVE TO HOST THE BACKEND AS WELL WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT LATER--
